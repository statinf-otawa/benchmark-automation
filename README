1. install the ARM toolchain (arm-none-eabi) and have it on your path (should be in most package repositories)
2. Take arm-disasm out of otawa-project/armv7t/disasm and drop it in the armv7 folder
3. Copy arm-disasm to the thumbv7 folder as well
3. Ensure the benchmarks you wish to compile are in benchmark_cfiles
4. run "make" in the project's root directory

You will have the output of "diff" for each benchmark, disassembled by both gliss and objdump, added to the root directory with a name like "<benchmarkname>-<ISA>-diffs.txt"

Make targets: all, armv7, thumbv7, clean
